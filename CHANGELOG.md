# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.1] – 2026-11-04

### Fixed
- Dragging the mouse across the board or double-clicking a tile no longer selects the labels of the tiles. Text in the details panel, dialogs and forms stays selectable.

## [1.1.0] – 2026-11-03

### Added
- Bundled traces: traces that end at the same component and port share one trunk there, and their moving dots add up on it. Ports that differ stay separate.
- End marks: where a trace leaves the board towards a peer outside the local network, a label names the peer (or "3 sources" with a drop-down list and shares). When the board scrolls, marks at the top and bottom edge point to components outside the view.
- Port marks: the destination port or protocol at the end of a live trace (from observed connections, otherwise from the scan). Unknown ports are left out.
- The board engine is now a documented core with versioned interfaces (`core-manifest.json`, [docs/ARCHITECTURE-CORE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE-CORE.md)): router, bundled traces, end marks and port marks take everything from a host object, texts from a translation callback and colours from `--ll-*` custom properties.
- `LANLOOM_TRUSTED_PROXIES`: addresses or networks of your reverse proxies. Only these may set `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and the sign-in rate limit then counts the real client. A new "Behind a reverse proxy" section in the installation guide explains the setup.
- Free text found on the network (page titles, server headers, discovery names and fields) no longer carries passwords from URLs or long access tokens; they are shown as "[hidden]".
- New tests prove the read-only promise from the source code, check that every route needs a session unless it is explicitly public, and check that demo data and fixtures hold no secrets.
- A hang guard for the test suite and job timeouts in CI.

### Changed
- The trace router uses the tuned costs of the newer engine: fewer bends, fewer crossings, buses that stay together. Routes are cached under a new key, so the board is routed once again after the update.
- The update check reads the list of releases and offers the highest stable version. A later bug-fix release for an older line no longer hides a newer version.
- After a failed update check, the next try comes after 15 minutes instead of 6 hours.
- The updater only trusts a candidate image whose self-test exits 0 and reports "selftest: ok" with the requested version.
- IPv6 clients are rate limited per /64.

### Fixed
- Two update requests at nearly the same time (double click, second tab) could fail with a server error. Now one is accepted, and the other is refused as "busy" while a request waits or an update runs.
- A repeated request after a successful update showed "failed: already current". Refusals now leave the finished status in place or show a notice instead of an error.
- The update dialog could stop early because it read the status of an earlier run.
- Behind a reverse proxy, one person typing wrong passwords locked everybody out. Flooding the rate limiter with many addresses could reset an active lock-out.
- A forwarded protocol header from any client could mark the session cookie `Secure`.
- The trial start of an update candidate could be made to scan the network. It now only answers the health check.
- SNMP counter jumps larger than the link speed allows are discarded instead of showing up as traffic bursts.

## [1.0.0] – 2026-11-01

First public release.

### Added
- Circuit-board map of the local network: components in zones, traces routed orthogonally and at 45° with buses and vias.
- Two views: Map (overview by kind) and Network (gateway plus one zone per subnet).
- Moving dots for measured bytes with byte conservation and an automatically chosen quantum (powers of two, default 1 dot ≈ 64 KiB); unmeasured traces are dashed.
- Live grade per source and component: realtime, near, periodic, sluggish, interrupted, unknown.
- Gentle scan (neighbour table, mDNS/DNS-SD, SSDP, TCP connect to 26 well-known ports, HTTP(S) title and header) and consent-gated deep scan (about 218 ports), both rate-limited and private-ranges only.
- Presence check every 2 minutes and automatic gentle rescan (default every 6 hours).
- Deterministic device classifier with confidence levels (sure, probable, unknown) and reasons.
- Component card with classification, open ports, announcements, recent traffic chart, rename, re-type and hide.
- Device list with search; light, dark and auto theme; phone layout with bottom tabs; English and German UI.
- Setup wizard: account, networks, scan, review, connect, done.
- Optional read-only integrations: home-automation hub (WebSocket API), MQTT broker, router or switch (SNMP v2c and v3). Credentials are encrypted at rest.
- Live byte counters for this host's TCP flows via kernel socket diagnostics.
- Mandatory sign-in with one-time setup code, argon2id passwords, optional passkeys, session cookies, login rate limiting, cross-site request protection and a strict content security policy.
- Optional one-click updater sidecar with self-test, trial start, database backup, previous-image tag, health check and automatic rollback; optional update check that can be disabled.
- One-line installer, compose file, multi-architecture images (amd64, arm64) and a built-in demo mode with a fictional network.
